# Chatbot
1. Supervised learning approach for a chatbot using a neural network model
2. P.S. If you read the code you can tell this was supposed to be a "hacker" bot. You can just remove the responses list if you like. **There will be issues...**
3. There is another bot that does what you're doing but it's random predefined words (I should probably remove it), you can ignore it. It does have logic, it's not completely random.
# How to Use
- There isn't much but you do need a trained model.
1. Run Chatbot_train.py
2. Create Model from there
3. Run Chatbot.py
# Common Errors
